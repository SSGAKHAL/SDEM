# EBMLInspect Format Definition for SdEM Files
#
# Format definitions are in the format:
# [class id],[type],[name],[optional help text]
#
# If hex has been set on the first line, class id is as
# a hexadecimal number. If hex is not set, class id
# is assumed to be decimal.
#
# Lines beginning with # are comments,
# Comments cannot be included after an entry, the line
# must start with #.
#
# Blank lines are ignored.
#
# Including the keyword "fullstop" as the only item on a line
# will keep the program from reading past it.
